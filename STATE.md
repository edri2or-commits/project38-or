## Active Context

### What I'm Working On
Testing the GSD STATE.md pattern to see if it improves session continuity and reduces context rot.

### Key Files This Session
- `STATE.md` (this file) - New, experiment
- `docs/research/notes/2026-01-25-saas-factory-gsd-framework.md` - Research source

### Decisions Made This Session
1. Classified GSD research as "Spike" - warrants experimentation
2. Decided to test STATE.md pattern immediately rather than backlog

---

## Next Steps

1. **Commit STATE.md** to repository
2. **Test resumption** - Start new session, read STATE.md, verify context reload works
3. **Measure** - Track if context stays cleaner over long sessions
4. **Decide** - After 2-3 sessions, decide to adopt/reject/modify
